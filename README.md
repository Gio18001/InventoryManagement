# Overview

Inventory Management System

This program provides an easy place to manage an inventory. There are 3 management options, Add Item, Remove Item, and List Items.

This program will keep track of different items, including their price and how many are available. Should you use the add or
remove features on an existing item, it changes only the quantity, except in the case you remove the entire quantity of an item,
at which point it will be removed from the inventory entirely.
